# Papers

- **Client-Hook Driven Live Streaming of Game Events with Transparent Token Rewards**  
  A client overlay signs and streams in-game events so they can be rewarded and audited without trusting the game server.

- **ZK-DABE: Zero-Knowledge and Ledger-Anchored Multi-Authority ABE**  
  A multi-authority ABE scheme where access, revocation, and “NOT” policies are enforced via zero-knowledge proofs on a public ledger.

- **Confidential Telemetry at Line Rate**  
  A telemetry pipeline that uses streaming zero-knowledge proofs to show that high-rate encrypted metrics satisfy a policy before being accepted.

### Note

These papers were developed in parallel, so they intentionally reuse several cryptographic and systems building blocks.
